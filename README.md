# ðŸ§  Data Mining Weekly Reports

This repository contains weekly Jupyter Notebook analyses developed as part of the **Data Mining** coursework.  
Each notebook presents applied data analysis, text processing, and visualization tasks using Python-based libraries.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The project aims to explore and implement fundamental techniques in **data mining**, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Text extraction and linguistic processing (NLP)  
- Word frequency and keyword analysis  
- Data visualization through charts and word clouds  

Weekly updates reflect the continuous progression of practical exercises, theoretical concepts, and experimentation with real-world datasets.
